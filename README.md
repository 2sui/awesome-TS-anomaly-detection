## Benchmark Datasets

- Numenta's [NAB](https://github.com/numenta/NAB)
> NAB is a novel benchmark for evaluating algorithms for anomaly detection in streaming, real-time applications. It is comprised of over 50 labeled real-world and artificial timeseries data files plus a novel scoring mechanism designed for real-time applications.
- Yahoo's [Webscope S5](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s&did=70)
> The dataset consists of real and synthetic time-series with tagged anomaly points. The dataset tests the detection accuracy of various anomaly-types including outliers and change-points.
